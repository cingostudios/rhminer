https://github.com/polyminer1/rhminer/blob/master/Release

## Mining with pool
To mine with pool you'll need PascalCoin address (local wallet or exchange).
```
Pool mining examples:

For exchange wallet :  rhminer.exe -cpu -cputhreads 8 -s pasc-eu1.nanopool.org:15555 -su YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS.YOUR_PAYMENT_ID.YOUR_WORKER_NAME/YOUR_EMAIL -fo pasc-eu2.nanopool.org:15555 -fou YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS.YOUR_PAYMENT_ID.YOUR_WORKER_NAME/YOUR_EMAIL -r 20 -v 2 -logfilename rhminer.log

For local wallet :  rhminer.exe -cpu -cputhreads 8 -s pasc-eu1.nanopool.org:15555 -su YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS.0.YOUR_WORKER_NAME/YOUR_EMAIL -fo pasc-eu2.nanopool.org:15555 -fou YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS.0.YOUR_WORKER_NAME/YOUR_EMAIL -r 20 -v 2 -logfilename rhminer.log
```

## Mining locally/Solo
To mine locally/solo you'll need the official PascalCoin wallet https://github.com/PascalCoin/PascalCoin/releases <br>
In order to mine locally with rhminer, **You need to set a miner name smaller than 26 characters and mine into a private key with encryption type secp256k1**<br>
The best way to assure you're mining in a secp256k1 private key is to create one and select it in the option **"Always mine with this key"**.<br>
**Do not use the "Use random existing key" option** because if one of your key is not a secp256k1 key, the miner will exit when. Plus when there is to much keys in the wallet it gives out errors, sometimes, when submiting nonces<br>
To ensure your miner name is correct, go to Project menu, then Options and set a miner name smaller than 26 characters<br>

```
Solo mining examples:

For Test net solo mining :  rhminer.exe -v 2 -r 20 -s http://127.0.0.1:4109 -cpu -cputhreads 1 -gpu 0 -gputhreads 100 -extrapayload HelloWorld
For Main net solo mining :  rhminer.exe -v 2 -r 20 -s http://127.0.0.1:4009 -cpu -cputhreads 1 -gpu 0 -gputhreads 100 -extrapayload HelloWorld

NOTE: remove -gpu 0 -gputhreads 100 if you dont have a gpu
```
Note2: It is not recommended to mine using a laptop.

## Supported Cuda architecture
* Kepler  GTX  700 series, Tesla K40/K80
* Maxwell GTX  900 series, Quadro M series, GTX Titan X
* Pascal  GTX 1000 series, Titan Xp, Tesla P40, Tesla P4,GP100/Tesla P100 â€“ DGX-1
* Volta   GTX 1100 series (GV104), Tesla V100

## Gpu mining
To mine using gpu you must provide the gpu numbers and the amount of threads for each gpu.<br>
If you only have one gpu, use **-gpu 0** and **-gputhreads {amount of threads}**<br>
If you have more than one gpus, you can see their number by executing the miner with the *list* option :<br> 
``` 
C:>rhminer -list 

  rhminer v0.9 beta for CPU and NVIDIA GPUs by polyminer1 (http://github.com/polyminer1)
  NVIDIA CUDA SDK 9.2

  Donations : Pascal account 529692-23
  Donations : Bitcoin address 19GfXGpRJfwcHPx2Nf8wHgMps8Eat1o4Jp

List of gpus and cpus:
GPU0 : GeForce GTX 1060 3GB
GPU1 : GeForce GTX 1060 3GB
GPU2 : GeForce GTX 950 2GB
CPU  : Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4460 CPU @ 3.20GHz
```
Then select the ones you want to mine with like this : <br> 
```
rhminer -s http://localhost:4009 -gpu 1,2 -gputhreads 262,102
```

## Ideal CUDA threads count
To find the ideal maximum amount of threads, start with 75% of the memory divided by 8.8. <br>
For a GTX 1060 3GB that is 3000 * 0.75 / 8.8 = 255 threads. <br>
Then run 2 minutes and if everything is stable, raise by say 32 until you get no crashes after 2 min.<br>
To help you in that process, look for the log line that say "CUDA: Using " when the miner starts. It  will indicate how much memory you take and how much is left depending on your selected thread count.<br>
**ALLWAYS** let at lease 150 meg of free memory, for internal OS operations, or you have stability issues.<br>


## Tested on 
CPU: I3, I5, Core2, Xeon, Athlon <br>
GPU: GTX 950, GTX 1060, GTX 1070 <br>
CUDA: Linux CUDA 9.1, Windows CUDA 9.2 <br>

## Upcoming
* CPU optimization using SSe4 and AVX
* Adding more stability to GPU mining
* GPU optimizations
* curl Api for stats and control

## Stability issues
Thre are some limitations on nvidia gpu to consider.

First, the kernel is not 100% stable in all settings. This mean you'll have to experiment to find the stable sweet spot in term of gputhreads. Maximum thread count does not mean maximum speed. Sometimes lower thread count will give you more stability and more speed also.

On multiple gpu rigs, it's NOT recommended to mine CPU at the same time. You'll have more kernel timeout error because the driver will lack cpu time.<br>
Also, it is recommented, on multiple GPU rigs, to run the miner in a loop in a batch file !

## Troubleshoot
On Windows 7/8/10, if you get the missing OpenCL.dll error you need to download it into rhminer's folder. (hint: You can safely get one with the Intel SDK on Intel's opencl website)


## Command line options
```
General options:
  -list                 List all gpu in the system
  -diff                 Set local difficulyu. ex: -diff 0.832
  -logfilename          Set the name of the log's filename. Note: the log file will be overwritten every time you start rhminer
  -extrapayload         An extra payload to be added when submiting solution to local wallet.
  -displayspeedtimeout  Display mining speeds every x seconds. Default is 10
  -processpriority      Set miner's process priority. 0=Background Process, 1=Low Priority, 2=Normal Priority. Default is 2. WARNING: Changing this value will affect GPU mining.
  -v                    Log verbosity. From 0 to 3. 0 no log, 1 normal log, 2 include warnings. Default is 1
  -devfee               Set devfee raward percentage. To disable devfee, simply put 0 here. But, before disabling developer fees, consider that it takes time and energy to maintain, develop and optimize this software. Your help is very appreciated.
  -completelist         Exhaustive list of all devices in the system
  -processorsaffinity   Force miner to only run on selected logical core processors. ex: -processorsaffinity 0,3 will make the miner run only on logical core #0 and #3. WARNING: Changing this value will affect GPU mining.
  -maxsubmiterrors      Stop the miner when a number of consecutive submit errors occured. Default is 10 consecutive errors. This is usefull when mining into local wallet.

Gpu options:
  -cpu                  Enable the use of CPU to mine. ex '-cpu -cputhread 4' will enable mining on cpu while gpu mining.
  -cputhreads           Number of CPU miner threads when mining with CPU. ex: -cpu -cputhread 4
  -gputhreads           Cuda thread count. ex: -gputhreads  100 launche 100 threads on selected gpu
  -gpu                  Enable indiviaual GPU by their index. GPU not in the list will be disabled. ex: -gpu 0,3,4.
  -kernelactivewayting  Enable active wayting on kernel run. This will raise cpu usage but bring more stability, specially when mining on multiple gpu. WARNING: This affect cpu mining

Network options:
  -dar                  Disable auto-reconnect on connection lost. Note : The miner will exit uppon loosing connection.
  -s                    Stratum server or wallet address:port. NOTE: You can also use http://address.xyz to connect to local wallet.
  -su                   Stratum user
  -pw                   Stratum password
  -fo                   Failover address:port for stratum or local wallet
  -fou                  Failover user for stratum of a local wallet
  -fop                  Failover password for stratum or local wallet
  -r                    Retries connection count for stratum or local wallet
```

## Developer Donation
Default donation is 1%. <br>
Donation is hardcoded in the binaries downloadable on gitgub. That is to recoup the 6 month it toke to R&D, develop, stabilize and optimize this miner and for the upcoming bug fixes and many upcoming optimizations. <br>
To disable donation download and compile locally, then use the -disabledevfee option. <br>
